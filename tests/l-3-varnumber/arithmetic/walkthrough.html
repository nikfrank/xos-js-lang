  alright, let's learn about variables! what up

  variables come in five main types 

  strings 'like this' "or this"

  numbers (0 * 6.4 + (-129847)/37) % 52

  bools true || false

  objects {key:'field', 'whatever':10}

  arrays ['something', 10, {more:'stuff'}] //(which are really just objects under the hood)
</pre>
<hr/>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  // variables are all made the same way

  var name;

  // not like other languages where we have to decide what type it is upfront

  // we can also give them a value right away (on initialization)

  var age = 18;
  var country = 'Canada';

  // or make a bunch at once

  var province = 'BC', city = 'Vancouver';

  // which we could've made as an object for convenience

  var locale = {country:'Canada', province:'BC', city:'Vancouver'};

  // each variable type has operators which make doing stuff with them possible and easy
  // here, we'll learn about what we can do with numbers

  // To pass this test - go into the main.js, and make all of the if statements evaluate to true
  // (without changing the if statements of course... I can see what you're up to!)
