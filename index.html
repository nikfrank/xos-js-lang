    <h1> Open up the console </h1>

    <p>Most users just hit f12, mac will need to right click - inspect element </p>
    <p> then clikc on the console tab (if not already there)</p>
    <p> I think it's available in the menus somewhere, but honestly, who uses those?</p>

    <!--you've found the page source! you can also look through this in the "inspect element"-->
    <!--pane of the developer tools - which also has some handy tools for checking the DOM-->
    <!--make another console statement and run the test and you'll get the points-->
    <!--seriously though, from now on you'll actually have to do stuff-->
    <!--make sure you format the input as a string!-->

    <script type="text/javascript" id="userscript">

      console.log('hi!, you\'ve found the console. You can enter javascript here to test');
      console.log('or you can use this as output from your code (like I\'m doing now)');
      console.log('if you want to see how this is running, view source (ctrl/command + u)');

    </script>
